                    <div class="p-desc-ind">Last Fall, for a senior design course, Paige, Tyler, Sina, and I worked on an 
                      experience design project where we identified a business problem and used design to solve the issue. 
                      As a result, we decided to improve the Mazda dealership vehicle maintenance product by leveraging 
                      existing touchpoints to improve the Mazda owner's vehicle maintenance experience. Additionally, we 
                      were also motivated to change the product's visual design. My primary responsibilities included 
                      creating a cohesive design system on Figma and improving the app's user experience.

                    50% of car dealership gross profits are from maintenance and repair services. However, according to Cox

                      Most vehicle owners we introduced said they prefer other service options like Jiffy Lube, Midas or independent mechanics and fail to trust dealerships. This is because they assume that dealers are more expensive and time-consuming. As there were many myths attached to their responses, we decided to increase the perceived value of services done at a dealership by addressing the emerging needs of vehicle owners concerning transparency and uncertainty of the services performed. Our aim was to improve the overall experience of Mazda owners from before the service began to till the end.

                    In 2021, Mazda released MyMazda, which allows the user to lock/unlock the car, adjust heating and control basic features of the vehicle. However, the user is taken out of the app several times to different third-party sites to accomplish tasks like booking a service appointment, getting service, payment, etc. Hence, we saw an opportunity to integrate all touchpoints within the app to increase transparency about the time and cost of the service.

                    We wanted Mazda owners to know all of the service details of their cars through this app. Hence, we created a service section in one of the apps where they get complete information about upcoming services and maintenance required for specific car parts. This allows us to increase the transparency of their repair services, communicate both the “what” and “why” of service and remove booking friction, thereby increasing the number of owners who follow through with the appointment.

                  One of the main reasons vehicle owners didn't go to dealerships was the lack of trust. By giving step-by-step details of the service, we can establish a trustworthy connection between the owner and service team, accommodate busy schedules by providing live updates and provide price transparency to mitigate owner frustration and anxiety.

                  Every time before the service begins, the mechanic performs an inspection to check if any additional services are required. Instead of asking the vehicle owner through third-party applications, they can send a video of the issue and ask via the app. By giving the control to the owner to make decisions for their vehicle, we can provide transparency through updating vehicle status throughout service and additional evidence through video and facilitate digital decision-making to help owners make choices based on knowledge rather than social pressure.

                  By bringing the payment touchpoint inside the app, we can remove any kind of payment friction to provide a

                <div class="p-desc-ind">
                  A service history folder is essential for any vehicle owner, especially when selling the car, and we decided to digitalize it and integrate it into the MyMazda App. They can now see details about every service and show the next potential owner that the car was well-cared for. The service history tab includes the service summary, service videos, inspection reports and the receipt. Finding details about a specific service through the app is more straightforward than looking through multiple receipts in the vehicle's glove box. Additionally, it acts as a touchpoint for a new owner to onboard the MyMazda application.

                    One of my main responsibilities in the team was User Interface Design. My initial process was to find inspiration for different ways to add features we outlined to improve the app's user experience. My process included taking ideas from existing apps on my phone, Dribble and Pinterest. Once I had enough pictures, I created an outline incorporating those ideas into our user flow. Tyler and Sina then took over the visual design of the app.
