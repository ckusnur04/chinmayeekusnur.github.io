                      After gathering feedback from numerous vehicle owners, we discovered that many of them preferred alternative 
			    service options like Jiffy Lube, Midas, or independent mechanics over dealerships. The prevailing 
			    perception was that dealerships were more costly and time-consuming, leading to a lack of trust in 
			    their services. To combat these misconceptions and increase the perceived value of dealership services, 
			    we decided to address the emerging needs of vehicle owners regarding transparency and uncertainty in the 
			    services provided. Our goal was to enhance the overall experience of Mazda owners throughout the entire 
			    service process, from the moment they arrive until the completion of the service.

                   In 2021, Mazda launched MyMazda, a mobile app enabling users to lock/unlock the car, adjust heating, and control 
			  fundamental vehicle features. Despite its functionality, the app had some limitations as users were redirected 
			  multiple times to various third-party sites for tasks such as booking service appointments, making payments, 
			  and getting service. Recognizing this opportunity for improvement, we aimed to integrate all touchpoints 
			  directly within the app. Our objective was to enhance transparency by providing users with clear information 
			  about the time and cost of the service, all within the seamless experience of the MyMazda app.

                    We wanted Mazda owners to know all of the service details of their cars through this app. Hence, we created a service section in one of the apps where they get complete information about upcoming services and maintenance required for specific car parts. This allows us to increase the transparency of their repair services, communicate both the “what” and “why” of service and remove booking friction, thereby increasing the number of owners who follow through with the appointment.

                  One of the main reasons vehicle owners didn't go to dealerships was the lack of trust. By giving step-by-step details of the service, we can establish a trustworthy connection between the owner and service team, accommodate busy schedules by providing live updates and provide price transparency to mitigate owner frustration and anxiety.

                  Every time before the service begins, the mechanic performs an inspection to check if any additional services are required. Instead of asking the vehicle owner through third-party applications, they can send a video of the issue and ask via the app. By giving the control to the owner to make decisions for their vehicle, we can provide transparency through updating vehicle status throughout service and additional evidence through video and facilitate digital decision-making to help owners make choices based on knowledge rather than social pressure.

                  A service history folder is essential for any vehicle owner, especially when selling the car, and we decided to digitalize it and integrate it into the MyMazda App. They can now see details about every service and show the next potential owner that the car was well-cared for. The service history tab includes the service summary, service videos, inspection reports and the receipt. Finding details about a specific service through the app is more straightforward than looking through multiple receipts in the vehicle's glove box. Additionally, it acts as a touchpoint for a new owner to onboard the MyMazda application.
