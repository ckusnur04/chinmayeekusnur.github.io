                <div class="content-body">A senior design course project focused on experience design. 
                    Our objective was to address a business problem by applying 
                    design principles to find a solution. Our direction involved 
                    enhancing the Mazda dealership vehicle maintenance product, 
                    with a focus on leveraging existing touchpoints to elevate 
                    the overall vehicle maintenance experience for Mazda owners. 
                    In this project, my main responsibilities revolved around 
                    crafting a unified design system using Figma and refining 
                    the user experience of the app.</div>

                <div class="content-body">50% of car dealership gross profits are 
                    from maintenance and repair services. However, according to 
                    Cox Automative maintenance and repair study 65% of vehicle 
                    owners do not get their vehicle serviced at a dealership due 
                    to a poor experience caused by:

                <div class="content-title">Area of Intervention</div>
                <div class="content-body">After gathering feedback from numerous vehicle 
                    owners, we discovered that many of them preferred alternative service 
                    options like Jiffy Lube, Midas, or independent mechanics over 
                    dealerships. The prevailing perception was that dealerships were more 
                    costly and time-consuming, leading to a lack of trust in their services. 
                    To combat these misconceptions and increase the perceived value of 
                    dealership services, we decided to address the emerging needs of 
                    vehicle owners regarding transparency and uncertainty in the services 
                    provided. Our goal was to enhance the overall experience of Mazda owners 
                    throughout the entire service process, from the moment they arrive until 
                    the completion of the service.

                <div class="content-title">Framing the Problem</div>
                <div class="content-body">In 2021, Mazda launched MyMazda, a mobile app enabling 
                    users to lock/unlock the car, adjust heating, and control fundamental vehicle 
                    features. Despite its functionality, the app had some limitations as users 
                    were redirected multiple times to various third-party sites for tasks such 
                    as booking service appointments, making payments, and getting service. 
                    Recognizing this opportunity for improvement, we aimed to integrate all 
                    touchpoints directly within the app. Our objective was to enhance 
                    transparency by providing users with clear information about the time and 
                    cost of the service, all within the seamless experience of the MyMazda app.

                <div class="content-body">We wanted Mazda owners to know all of the service 
                    details of their cars through this app. Hence, we created a service section 
                    in one of the apps where they get complete information about upcoming 
                    services and maintenance required for specific car parts. This allows us 
                    to increase the transparency of their repair services, communicate both 
                    the “what” and “why” of service and remove booking friction, thereby 
                    increasing the number of owners who follow through with the appointment.

                <div class="content-body">One of the main reasons vehicle owners didn't go to 
                    dealerships was the lack of trust. By giving step-by-step details of the 
                    service, we can establish a trustworthy connection between the owner and 
                    service team, accommodate busy schedules by providing live updates and 
                    provide price transparency to mitigate owner frustration and anxiety.

                    performs an inspection to check if any additional services are required. 
                    Instead of asking the vehicle owner through third-party applications, 
                    they can send a video of the issue and ask via the app. By giving the 
                    control to the owner to make decisions for their vehicle, we can provide 
                    transparency through updating vehicle status throughout service and 
                    additional evidence through video and facilitate more informed decision making.

                    can remove any kind of payment friction to provide a thoughtful end-of-service

                    videos, inspection reports and the receipt. Additionally, it acts as a touchpoint 
                    for a new owner to onboard the MyMazda application.
