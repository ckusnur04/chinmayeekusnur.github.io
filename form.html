                    <div class="p-desc-ind">Last summer, I had a fantastic opportunity 
                      to intern at FORM as a digital product designer. I met some amazing 
                      people there who helped me grow as a designer, and I will always be 
                      grateful for this chance I got. 
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-desc-ind">My primary responsibilities were working 
                      closely with other Product team members to brainstorm ideas to 
                      improve the swim experience for users. Secondly, to craft UX 
                      deliverables such as annotated user flows and wireframes to 
                      effectively communicate design ideas. Lastly, to deliver 
                      high-fidelity UI designs for iOS, Android and FORM goggles. 
                      This summer, I had a fantastic opportunity to intern at FORM 
                      as a digital product designer. I met some amazing people there 
                      who helped me grow as a designer, and I will always be grateful

                    <span class="bold">Workout Filters</span> were the main feature I worked on at FORM. From understanding 
                    technical swim terms to ad-hoc user testing and prototyping, I was responsible 
                    for the design process. The main goal to accomplish with these filters was <span class="bold">to 
                    enable swimmers to find the best workout for their next swim.</span> I designed 6 
                    filters: Duration, Pool Size, Stroke, Drills, Equipment, and Longest Interval.

                  <div class="p-desc-ind">
                    My process started with analyzing how FORM's competitors use filters on their apps. 
                    The most challenging filters to design were duration, pool size and longest interval.
                    Here are a few of my sketches/iterations of some filters. 
                  </div>

                  </div>

                  <div class="p-desc-ind" id="t">
                    After prototyping the potential sketches, I also conducted ad-hoc usability 
                    tests with swimmers in the office to create the best user filters. This helped 
                    me understand the different pain points and requirements of swimmers. Based on 
                    the user testing, I concluded that potential users might need more context for 
                    some filters. Hence I added more information via the tooltip icon, as shown below.

                  <div class="p-desc-ind" id="t">
                    Initially, the application had only 3 filters, and after the addition of 6 filters, 
                    the filter page was long, and the user had to scroll for a while to see the last filter. 
                    Therefore, made the filter page in an accordion style to make the filtering process easy 
                    with utmost transparency.

                    <div class="p-desc-ind"><span class="bold">1. Use a design system on Figma properly.</span>
                      I was exposed to a design 
                      system more extensive than I had ever used before. I learned how 
                      to use components, instances and variants, which helped me be more 
                      consistent and detail-oriented.

                      <span class="bold">2. Communicate design ideas clearly, confidently and effectively.</span>
                      As a designer, it was essential for me to learn 
                        the art of presenting designs well to the team and effectively 
                        conveying my idea. Unfortunately, it took some time for me to be 
                        organized and efficient in this matter. But now, I can 
                        present my designs confidently and say why a particular idea works 
                        to improve user experience. I realised that 90% of the process of designing 
                        is communication!
