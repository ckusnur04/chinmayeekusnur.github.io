                <div class="content-body">In summer 2022, I had a fantastic opportunity to 
                    intern at FORM as a digital product designer. I met some amazing people 
                    there who helped me grow as a designer, and I will always be grateful 
                    for this chance I got. My main task was to add more workout filters to
                    make it easy for swimmers to find their desired workout.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-title">Problem</div>
                <div class="content-body">Previously, the app offered only three filters—Category, Distance, and Intensity—for discovering workouts, limiting users' ability to fine-tune their selections. This constraint posed challenges for swimmers seeking a tailored experience. In contrast, competitor fitness apps such as Peloton, Whoop, and Garmin boasted a more comprehensive array of search customization options, providing users with greater control over their fitness journey.

                <div class="content-title">My Process started with</div>
                <div class="content-body">an in-depth analysis of how FORM's competitors 
                    leverage filters within their apps. This exploration served as a 
                    foundation for my enhancement efforts, where I introduced pivotal 
                    filters such as Duration, Pool Size, Stroke, Drills, Equipment, and 
                    Longest Interval. Each addition was meticulously crafted after studying 
                    the nuanced requirements of users. Notably, the integration of Pool Size 
                    presented a unique challenge, leading to a thorough investigation into 
                    its intricacies and presenting it in a way which is not complicated to 
                    understand.

                <div class="content-title">Next step was to sketch</div>
                <div>
                    <div class="content-body">Sketching, following Jake Knapp's Sprint 
                        framework, was instrumental in my design process. It enabled 
                        rapid ideation, fostering creativity and collaboration. By 
                        simplifying complex ideas into visual representations, it 
                        facilitated effective communication and validation, driving 
                        innovation and user-centric solutions. Especially for duration  
                        and poolsize as they could have multiple different variations  
                        and sketching allowed me to visualize all the variations.

                <div class="content-title">User Testing was essential to make crucial design decisions</div>
                <div class="content-body">After prototyping various sketches, I conducted 
                    ad-hoc usability testing sessions with swimmers in our office. This 
                    hands-on approach allowed me to gather valuable insights into their 
                    pain points and requirements. The user testing revealed a need for 
                    additional context for certain filters. Consequently, I enhanced the 
                    user experience by integrating tooltip icons, providing users with 
                    the necessary information at their fingertips.

                <div class="content-title">Accordian Style Filter Display</div>
                <div class="content-body">As mentioned earlier, originally, the 
                    application featured only three filters. However, with the 
                    incorporation of six additional filters, the filter page 
                    became cumbersome, requiring users to scroll extensively 
                    to access all options. Recognizing the importance of 
                    streamlined navigation and user convenience, I implemented 
                    an accordion-style layout for the filter page. This design 
                    decision not only alleviated the need for excessive scrolling 
                    but also enhanced the filtering process by providing users 
                    with a clear, organized interface. By condensing the filter 
                    options into a collapsible format, I prioritized ease of 
                    use and transparency, ensuring a seamless user experience.
