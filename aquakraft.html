                <div class="content-body">They wanted to revamp their existing website, which 
                    lacked an enticing story for potential customers and investors. Apart from 
                    the website, they also wanted me to create a corporate video, a letter head 
                    for their business documents and visiting card templates. Their goal was to 
                    create a visually compelling corporate website that truly highlighted their 
                    achievements. Moreover, some key topics they wanted to highlight all over 
                    the website were-

                <div class="content-body">I was confident in my assumptions but wanted to validate them with real feedback. 
                    So, I reached out to two investors and existing corporate customers in India to gather their thoughts on 
                    the website. Their feedback confirmed my suspicions—they struggled to understand AquaKraft's services and 
                    mission from the current website. 

                    One thing that caught my attention was a comment from a corporate customer. They mentioned that AquaKraft 
                    wins awards and gets featured in articles and videos often, but this isn't clearly shown on the website. 
                    This insight underscores the importance of showcasing such achievements to increase AquaKraft’s and the 
                    website's credibility.

                    guidelines to create a cohesive and appealing look. I also chose SF Pro Extended as the 
                    main font because my research showed that sans-serif fonts, which offer a modern and 
                    professional feel, are popular on sustainability websites. This combination helped make

                    they can send a video of the issue and ask via the app. By giving the 
                    control to the owner to make decisions for their vehicle, we can provide 
                    transparency through updating vehicle status throughout service and
