                    functionality over aesthetics for a developer-focused platform required 
                    a shift in work style and extensive research. An inspirational journey 
                    curated design elements aligned with project goals, acting as a key 
                    reference for the subsequent design phase. Analysing Nokia's websites, 
                    including color schemes and typography, guided the project's overall 
                    design direction. <span class="bold">Restricted by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), I am

                    challenges related to usability, information organization, and visual 
                    consistency, hindering user satisfaction. The need for a redesign arises 
                    to address these inherent issues and align the platform with modern design 
                    standards ad to increaser collaboration amongst the users.

                <div class="content-body">Diving into feature exploration, I navigated 
                    through user data and drew inspiration from Nokia's renowned design 
                    principles. My mission was clear: to craft tools that resonate deeply 
                    with developers' needs. My research unveiled a strong desire for 
                    collaboration features among users. Fueled by creativity, I explored 
                    a range of solutions.

                    After thorough analysis with the UX design team, product managers, 
                    and developers, three ideas emerged as the most promising: a 
                    blog-style hub for knowledge sharing, discussion forums, and 
                    integrating gamification elements. While I advocated for the 
                    combined implementation of all three to maximize value, the 
                    project's time constraints compelled a focused approach. 
                    Therefore, considering the limited timeframe of 6 weeks for 
                    design, development, testing, and deployment.

                    <div class="content-body"><span class="bold">1. Had 6 weeks to design, develop, test and implement:</span>
                        It was crucial to synchronize my design roadmap with the 
                        development roadmap, ensuring alignment with both end user
                        and business requirements. To achieve this, I leveraged 
                        existing elements and made necessary adaptations to seamlessly 
                        integrate them into my design.

                    <div class="content-body"><span class="bold">2. Align the new design to the existing visual design standards:</span>
                        While I was creating a completely different information 
                        architechture, I had to create something that was consistent with the rest of the site.</div>

            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-title">Solution</div>
                <div class="content-body">After careful consideration, I concluded 
                    that starting with a blog-style hub coupled with a discussion  
                    forum would initiate engagement effectively. By creating this  
                    hub, developers could easily share insights, improving knowledge 
                    exchange and fostering stronger collaboration.

            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-title">Decision 1: Two-Column Layout</div>
                <div class="content-body">To start, the web page had a clear two-column setup 
                    that helped make the content balanced and the overall web page easier to use. 
                    This layout provides users with an organized and easy-to-understand design 
                    that suits how they look for information, making their tasks quicker. One 
                    major reason for this change was to create a clear hierarchy and spotlight 
                    important parts, guiding users to what matters most. Another reason was to 
                    give flexibility to future designers so they can arrange content freely 
                    without being tied to a basic layout.

                <div class="content-title">Decision 2: Cards for enhanced content division</div>
                <div class="content-body">The second design decision centred around crafting cards 
                    that offer ample whitespace and encompass all the necessary information crucial 
                    for developers. Rather than placing two cards in a single row, I opted for a 
                    layout where each row features just one card. This strategy was chosen to provide 
                    developers with a clear and uncluttered visual experience, ensuring that they can 
                    readily access all the essential details they require.

                <div class="content-title">Decision 3: Tri-fold searching approach</div>
                <div class="content-body">This approach was implemented to facilitate precise 
                    content discovery. Firstly, an adjacent search bar was integrated, 
                    complemented by filtering alternatives, and finally, sorting options 
                    positioned at the top. This combination of searching tools works better 
                    for finding content compared to just using a search bar. It's also a widely 
                    recognized and commonly used technique in the industry for efficient content 
                    searching, therefore it is a more intuitive method, making the website easy 
                    to use.
